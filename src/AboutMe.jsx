            Since I was a child, I’ve always been driven by an innate desire to build, but the methods in which I created never seemed to matter as much as the act of creating itself. One day, that changed when my father brought me into his workshop and put me to work. A simple, dulled hand saw through a cheap block of junk wood was all I needed to catch an unforgettable wave of accomplishment. It wasn’t too long before I was nailing planks together to make swords, and as I grew, so did my aspirations. I set my eyes on larger and more complex projects, like a chair adorned with castle-like legs, ax themed chair arms, and an infinity cube placed above the headrest. I also spread my wings out from wood and created a beautiful ring for my mother to celebrate 30 years of wonderful marriage with my father. In college I milled and lathed a new bench vise, and I’ve got a lifetime of projects ahead of me.
